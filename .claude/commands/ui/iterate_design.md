**CREATE DESIGN VARIATIONS**

UI TO BUILD: $ARGUMENT

**GOAL**  
Your task is to launch **3 sub-agents in parallel** (at the same time), each working independently to create a unique variation of the same UI. This allows users to compare and choose the best design.

**Instructions for Each Sub-Agent**
1. Review the style guide in `prd/design-system.json` and any provided mockups for reference.
2. Build a single HTML page representing one screen of the UI, based on user feedback or the specified task.
3. Save your output in the `ui_iterations` folder, naming the file as `ui_{n}.html` (where `{n}` is a unique number, e.g., `ui_1.html`, `ui_2.html`, `ui_3.html`).

**Note:** All 3 sub-agents must work concurrently and independently to ensure diverse design outcomes.
