**CREATE REACT SINGLE-PAGE APP**

UI TO IMPLEMENT: $ARGUMENT

**GOAL**  
Your task is to convert the final HTML/CSS design into a **React** application (using the latest React version with **TypeScript**). The app should be a **single-page** front-end (no multi-page routing) that **progresses vertically** as the user navigates (all content on one page, revealed as the user scrolls or interacts). Use the provided design system guidelines for styling and structure.

**TASK**  
1. **Analyze the Design:** Review the final HTML file and the style guide in `prd/design-system.json`. Identify distinct UI components (e.g. header, footer, form sections, buttons, cards) and note style rules (colors, typography, spacing) from the design system for consistency:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
2. **Plan Component Structure:** Break the UI into reusable React components, following best practices (each component in its own file, under a `/components` folder):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. For example, determine which parts of the UI can be standalone components (buttons, inputs, navigation, etc.), and which larger sections (forms, lists, modals) will compose those components:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
3. **Setup React Project (TypeScript):** Initialize a React project structure with TypeScript. Create an entry point (e.g. `react_app/src/index.tsx`) and a root component (`App.tsx`) that will render the page. Use **functional components** with React Hooks for state and effects (avoiding class components, as functional components are preferred in modern React:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}). Ensure all components are written in TypeScript (`.tsx` files) with appropriate interfaces/types for props and state:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  
4. **Implement Components:** For each identified component, create a TypeScript React component that implements the corresponding part of the UI. Compose these components in the main `App` to match the final design layout. Keep components **small and focused** on a single responsibility (e.g. a `Button` component should just render a styled button) for clarity and reusability:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  
5. **Apply Styling & Design System:** Use the design tokens and style rules from `prd/design-system.json` for consistent styling. This may involve using CSS variables, classes, or a theme object that contains colors, font sizes, spacing, etc., defined in the design system:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. Ensure that the React components’ styles (CSS/SCSS or styled-components) align with the provided style guide (for example, use the primary color and typography from the design system for headings, buttons, etc.). If the design system specifies particular class names or components, apply them accordingly for uniformity:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. Include any necessary CSS files or styled-components in the project (you can create a global stylesheet or module CSS as needed).  
6. **Single-Page Behavior:** Implement the page as a single continuous application. There should be no full page reloads or separate routes – all content is accessible in one page view. If the UI has multiple sections or steps, manage their visibility or progression via React state or props. For example, you might use component state to reveal the next section when a user completes an action (creating a smooth scroll or transition to the next part of the page). The goal is a fluid **SPA user experience** where content updates dynamically as the user interacts, without navigating away.  
7. **Frontend-Only (Stub Backend):** No real backend integration is required at this stage. For any data that would typically come from an API, use placeholder logic or mock data. For instance, if a component needs to fetch data, instead call a stub function that returns a static JSON object or array (simulating an API response):contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}. Comment in the code where actual API calls would go, so it’s clear how to replace the stubs with real requests later.  
8. **Output Files:** Create the React project files in a new folder (e.g. `react_app`). This should include at minimum:  
   - `react_app/src/index.tsx` – the application entry point that renders `<App />` (using ReactDOM).  
   - `react_app/src/App.tsx` – the main App component that composes the page.  
   - `react_app/src/components/...` – a directory containing each React component file (e.g. `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `FormSection.tsx`, etc., each defining a functional component).  
   - Any CSS or asset files needed for the components (e.g. `App.css` or component-specific styles).  

All files should be properly organized and use clear, self-explanatory names. Ensure the project can be run to display the single-page app with the designed UI. Once done, save all files to the `react_app` folder (maintaining the structure above).
The files iterations should all be under frontend_1/ frontend_2 inside the `frontend_iterations` directory with all the components talked
